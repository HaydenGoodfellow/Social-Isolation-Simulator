# Social-Isolation-Simulator
This project graphically simulates the effect of social isolation on the spread of a contagious disease.

It was created to work with the ARM Cortex-A9 processor on the DE1-SoC board. Accomplishing this required the implementation of our own PS/2 keyboard and VGA display driver.

Please note: Due to the COVID-19 shutdown of in-person labs, this project had to be able to run on an [online ARM Cortex-A9 simulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc). Consequently, it had to be written entirely in one file as the simulator does not support linking files. Normally I would have written this project modularly in multiple files with clear names to improve code readability.

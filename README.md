# Social-Isolation-Simulator
This project graphically simulates the effect of social isolation on the spread of a contagious disease.

It was created to work with the ARM Cortex-A9 processor on the DE1-SoC board. Accomplishing this required the implementation of our own VGA display and PS/2 keyboard driver.
